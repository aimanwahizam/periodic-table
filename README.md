# periodic-table

## pseudocode

HOW TO MAKE LAYOUT:

1. Make a grid of 18 x 9
2. gap them



HOW TO MAKE STYLING:

1. make grid__item class - this will flex centre centre content 
2. make --color modifier to change color
3. include small number by moving relative position
4. make grid__gapy to make gaps

* MAYBE not make the whole box its container just so add small number?
